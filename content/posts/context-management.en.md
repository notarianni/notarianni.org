If your project only exists in your head,
your agents are blind.

An agent doesn't guess:
it only knows what you **write**.

So write. Everything. Simply.

In Markdown files.

Note throughout the day:

* What you're doing
* Why you're doing it
* Problems encountered
* Solutions tested
* What you're learning
* Decisions made
* Your plans (day / week / 6 months)

No novels.
Raw notes. Factual. Versioned.

Like a logbook.

These files become:

* your external memory
* your decision history
* your shared context
* the fuel for your prompts

Instead of saying:

> "improve the pipeline"

You can say:

> "based on /journal and /decisions, simplify the pipeline"

And there, the agent truly understands.

Documenting isn't reporting.
It's making your brain **programmable**.

Markdown + discipline > complicated tools.

Write more.
Your agents will get better.
