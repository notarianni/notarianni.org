title: "Should You Use BMAD, Spec-Kit, and Other AI Frameworks?"

At the beginning of 2026, it's now clear to many that AI **works** — and works very well. Experimentation is everywhere: everyone is testing, exploring, adjusting, in a continuous flourishing of ideas, workflows, and practices.

When exchanging feedback with my peers, the same refrain regularly comes up: **BMAD**, **Spec-Kit**, or other "turnkey" frameworks supposedly designed to effectively structure work with AI.

> *"You want to drive development through specs? You should use Spec-Kit."*

And for the umpteenth time, we share a link to a GitHub repo, as if the answer were already there.

This reflex is not surprising. In the world of "traditional" software, the framework is a rational response to a real problem. Tools like **Spring**, **Ruby on Rails**, or **React** emerged to pool costly abstractions to design, difficult to maintain, and critical to avoid constantly reinventing fragile solutions.

Their implicit promise was simple:
> *inventing a wheel is difficult, time-consuming, and risky — and you're likely to build a square wheel.*

In most cases, this promise was kept. Software history is marked by "homegrown" attempts that confirmed a simple truth: criticism is easy, art is difficult. The error is not in the reasoning… it's in its **mechanical application to a technology that radically changes the rules of the game**.

With AI, the cost of creation — both technical **and cognitive** — has dropped dramatically. Writing a prompt, structuring a context, defining an agent workflow or an MCP no longer has anything to do, in terms of effort, with designing a traditional software framework.

Today, a single person can, in a few hours:
- design a coherent AI workflow,
- iterate quickly,
- adapt it precisely to their real problem,
- and get better results than with a generic solution.

In this context, adopting an existing framework also means importing:
- implicit abstractions,
- inherited conventions,
- and sometimes unnecessary complexity for the problem to solve.

The spectacular gains observed with AI don't primarily come from tools. They come from the **quality of structured reasoning around AI**.

In practice, the truly determining factors are:
- clarity of objectives,
- quality and stability of context,
- input and output conventions,
- ability to iterate quickly with real feedback.

No framework can decide this for you. The best results observed in the field often come from simple, explicit workflows, sometimes even "cobbled together" — but perfectly aligned with the problem being addressed.

The real question is not:
> *"Which AI framework should I use?"*

But rather:
> *"What do I really need today?"*
> *"Am I exploring, or industrializing?"*
> *"What constraints am I willing to accept — and which ones can I avoid?"*

Creating software has never been easier. Creating relevant AI workflows hasn't either. AI frameworks are neither miracle solutions nor mistakes to be avoided at all costs. They are **tools**, useful at a given moment — but incapable of thinking for you.
