<h1>Should You Use BMAD, Spec-Kit, and Other AI Frameworks?</h1>
<p>At the beginning of 2026, it&rsquo;s now clear to many that AI <strong>works</strong> — and works very well.<br>
Experimentation is everywhere: everyone is testing, exploring, adjusting, in a continuous flourishing of ideas, workflows, and practices.</p>
<p>When exchanging feedback with my peers, the same refrain regularly comes up:<br>
<strong>BMAD</strong>, <strong>Spec-Kit</strong>, or other &ldquo;turnkey&rdquo; frameworks supposedly designed to effectively structure work with AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;You want to drive development through specs? You should use Spec-Kit.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for the umpteenth time, we share a link to a GitHub repo, as if the answer were already there.</p>
<h2 id="the-framework-reflex-a-legacy-from-traditional-software">The Framework Reflex: A Legacy from Traditional Software</h2>
<p>This reflex is not surprising.<br>
In the world of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; software, the framework is a rational response to a real problem.</p>
<p>Tools like <strong>Spring</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, or <strong>React</strong> emerged to pool costly abstractions to design, difficult to maintain, and critical to avoid constantly reinventing fragile solutions.</p>
<p>Their implicit promise was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>inventing a wheel is difficult, time-consuming, and risky — and you&rsquo;re likely to build a square wheel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In most cases, this promise was kept.<br>
Software history is marked by &ldquo;homegrown&rdquo; attempts that confirmed a simple truth: criticism is easy, art is difficult.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-reasoning-breaks-down-with-ai">Why This Reasoning Breaks Down with AI</h2>
<p>The error is not in the reasoning…<br>
it&rsquo;s in its <strong>mechanical application to a technology that radically changes the rules of the game</strong>.</p>
<p>With AI, the cost of creation — both technical <strong>and cognitive</strong> — has dropped dramatically.<br>
Writing a prompt, structuring a context, defining an agent workflow or an MCP no longer has anything to do, in terms of effort, with designing a traditional software framework.</p>
<p>Today, a single person can, in a few hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>design a coherent AI workflow,</li>
<li>iterate quickly,</li>
<li>adapt it precisely to their real problem,</li>
<li>and get better results than with a generic solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, adopting an existing framework also means importing:</p>
<ul>
<li>implicit abstractions,</li>
<li>inherited conventions,</li>
<li>and sometimes unnecessary complexity for the problem to solve.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-real-leverage-is-not-the-framework-but-the-workflow">The Real Leverage Is Not the Framework, but the Workflow</h2>
<p>The spectacular gains observed with AI don&rsquo;t primarily come from tools.<br>
They come from the <strong>quality of structured reasoning around AI</strong>.</p>
<p>In practice, the truly determining factors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>clarity of objectives,</li>
<li>quality and stability of context,</li>
<li>input and output conventions,</li>
<li>ability to iterate quickly with real feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>No framework can decide this for you.</p>
<p>The best results observed in the field often come from simple, explicit workflows, sometimes even &ldquo;cobbled together&rdquo; — but perfectly aligned with the problem being addressed.</p>
<h2 id="where-ai-frameworks-remain-useful">Where AI Frameworks Remain Useful</h2>
<p>Rejecting frameworks wholesale would be a symmetrical error.</p>
<p>AI frameworks provide real value when:</p>
<ul>
<li>work is done <strong>with multiple people</strong>,</li>
<li>the focus is on <strong>industrialization</strong> rather than exploration,</li>
<li>standardization, observability, or reproducibility become critical,</li>
<li>transmission and collective memory take precedence over individual optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the exploration phase, the framework is often a hindrance,</li>
<li>in the stabilization phase, it can become an accelerator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is therefore not the existence of AI frameworks, but their <strong>premature adoption</strong>, often guided by hype rather than real need.</p>
<h2 id="the-trap-of-unacknowledged-homegrown-solutions">The Trap of Unacknowledged &ldquo;Homegrown&rdquo; Solutions</h2>
<p>Conversely, creating your own AI framework is not free either.</p>
<p>Without explicit discipline:</p>
<ul>
<li>prompts drift,</li>
<li>conventions become implicit,</li>
<li>the reasons for choices are lost,</li>
<li>and what worked &ldquo;by magic&rdquo; suddenly stops working.</li>
</ul>
<p>A framework — even an imperfect one — sometimes forces one essential thing: <strong>making decisions visible and transmissible</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a cost that should not be ignored.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-reversing-the-question">Conclusion: Reversing the Question</h2>
<p>The real question is not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Which AI framework should I use?&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But rather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;What do I really need today?&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;Am I exploring, or industrializing?&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;What constraints am I willing to accept — and which ones can I avoid?&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating software has never been easier.<br>
Creating relevant AI workflows hasn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>AI frameworks are neither miracle solutions nor mistakes to be avoided at all costs.<br>
They are <strong>tools</strong>, useful at a given moment — but incapable of thinking for you.</p>
<p>And perhaps that&rsquo;s the most important change brought by AI: the responsibility for structure now fully returns to humans.</p>
