<h1>Should You Use BMAD, Spec-Kit, and Other AI Frameworks?</h1>
<p>At the beginning of 2026, it&rsquo;s now clear to many that AI <strong>works</strong> — and works very well. Experimentation is everywhere: everyone is testing, exploring, adjusting, in a continuous flourishing of ideas, workflows, and practices.</p>
<p>When exchanging feedback with my peers, the same refrain regularly comes up: <strong>BMAD</strong>, <strong>Spec-Kit</strong>, or other &ldquo;turnkey&rdquo; frameworks supposedly designed to effectively structure work with AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;You want to drive development through specs? You should use Spec-Kit.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for the umpteenth time, we share a link to a GitHub repo, as if the answer were already there.</p>
<p>This reflex is not surprising. In the world of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; software, the framework is a rational response to a real problem. Tools like <strong>Spring</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, or <strong>React</strong> emerged to pool costly abstractions to design, difficult to maintain, and critical to avoid constantly reinventing fragile solutions.</p>
<p>Their implicit promise was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>inventing a wheel is difficult, time-consuming, and risky — and you&rsquo;re likely to build a square wheel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In most cases, this promise was kept. Software history is marked by &ldquo;homegrown&rdquo; attempts that confirmed a simple truth: criticism is easy, art is difficult. The error is not in the reasoning… it&rsquo;s in its <strong>mechanical application to a technology that radically changes the rules of the game</strong>.</p>
<p>With AI, the cost of creation — both technical <strong>and cognitive</strong> — has dropped dramatically. Writing a prompt, structuring a context, defining an agent workflow or an MCP no longer has anything to do, in terms of effort, with designing a traditional software framework.</p>
<p>Today, a single person can, in a few hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>design a coherent AI workflow,</li>
<li>iterate quickly,</li>
<li>adapt it precisely to their real problem,</li>
<li>and get better results than with a generic solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, adopting an existing framework also means importing:</p>
<ul>
<li>implicit abstractions,</li>
<li>inherited conventions,</li>
<li>and sometimes unnecessary complexity for the problem to solve.</li>
</ul>
<p>The spectacular gains observed with AI don&rsquo;t primarily come from tools. They come from the <strong>quality of structured reasoning around AI</strong>.</p>
<p>In practice, the truly determining factors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>clarity of objectives,</li>
<li>quality and stability of context,</li>
<li>input and output conventions,</li>
<li>ability to iterate quickly with real feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>No framework can decide this for you. The best results observed in the field often come from simple, explicit workflows, sometimes even &ldquo;cobbled together&rdquo; — but perfectly aligned with the problem being addressed.</p>
<p>The real question is not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Which AI framework should I use?&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But rather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;What do I really need today?&rdquo;</em>
<em>&ldquo;Am I exploring, or industrializing?&rdquo;</em>
<em>&ldquo;What constraints am I willing to accept — and which ones can I avoid?&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating software has never been easier. Creating relevant AI workflows hasn&rsquo;t either. AI frameworks are neither miracle solutions nor mistakes to be avoided at all costs. They are <strong>tools</strong>, useful at a given moment — but incapable of thinking for you.</p>
